Safe Exam Browser for Windows (Legacy Version)

Please note that the SEB 2.x version for Windows is deprecated and is no longer being developed further, as Mozilla stopped supporting the XUL runtime used for embedding Firefox into SEB. Therefore also the embedded Firefox version 52 ESR cannot be updated to a newer version. Please transition to SEB 3.x, the code and releases can be found in the repository https://github.com/SafeExamBrowser/seb-win-refactoring. 

We can only give very limited support for SEB 2.x for Windows and cannot solve bigger issues. Please post feature request for missing features in SEB 3.x here: https://github.com/SafeExamBrowser/seb-win-refactoring/issues
